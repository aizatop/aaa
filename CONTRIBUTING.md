# Contributing to AliveAgain

Thanks for wanting to contribute — small contributions (typos, accessibility fixes, new countries) are very welcome.

How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Implement your change and add tests / visual verification where appropriate.
3. Run linters and dev server: `npm ci && npm run lint && npm run dev`.
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request against `main`.

Please follow the existing code style. If you're adding content (countries, attractions), update the `COUNTRIES` array in `src/pages/Home.jsx` and add images to the README or an assets folder.

Communication

- For bugs: open an issue using the `bug report` template.
- For new features: open a discussion or a feature request issue first.
